# Causes-of-Heart-DIsease-in-US

## Background  
  
Heart diseases also known as Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.  
In this white paper, we analyze a dataset to determine the major factors that contribute to the likelihood of developing heart disease. We will see various interactive visuals of the data obtained from the diagnosis of the patients and if they have the disease or not.  
These visuals can help medical professionals to determine and prescribe various medical treatments and treatment measures to the patients by comparing their diagnosis data with our analyzed data. It will also significantly reduce the time the medical professional takes to determine the patientsâ€™ problems.  

## Problem Statement  
  
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality in most races in the United States, with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking being the key risk factors. The 2020 Annual CDC survey data of 300k adults related to their health status contains information on risk factors.   
The problem is how to utilize the CDC survey data to identify patterns for the likelihood of heart disease in people. Also, poor data visualization is one of the factors which creates one of the biggest overarching problems in the healthcare industry.  

## Solution  
  
Power BI is the interactive data visualization software used in this project for creating, striking, engaging, and meaningful data visualizations that can help to break down even the most complex and convoluted healthcare problems into manageable component parts, giving solution providers a new level of insight into how to deliver the highest quality care to patients while succeeding with their strategic goals.

## Methodology  
  
The dataset used in this analysis is the 2020 Annual CDC survey data of 300+ thousand adults related to their health status and contains 18 attributes, including heart disease status, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol drinking status, stroke history, physical health, mental health, difficulty walking, gender, age category, race, diabetic status, physical activity, general health, sleep time, asthma history, kidney disease history, and skin cancer history. PowerBi was used to create visualizations and explore the relationships between these attributes and heart disease status.  

## Conclusion  
  
The analysis highlights age, mental health, smoking, and race as major factors associated with heart disease. These findings can be used to develop targeted interventions and prevention strategies to reduce the incidence and prevalence of heart disease. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms that link these factors to heart disease and to identify additional risk factors that may be important for prevention and treatment. According to WHO, the effects of behavioral risk factors may show up in individuals. Identifying those at the highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths.
